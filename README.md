About installPortainerRestartAlways.sh
A very simple script extract from portnair.io https://portainer.io/install.html in order to install portnair for docker with portnair automatic restart.
Every time i install portainer i always forget to add the persistent option in order that docker bring it up to live at the next reboot ...
Dear head scatterbrained this is my 2 cents for you in order to avoid us to do this by hand.
Have a nice day !
